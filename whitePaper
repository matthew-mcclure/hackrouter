# 1.0 Executive Summary
The swap project seeks to provide a trustless movie swap platform to enable the transfer of digital assets use from one user to another using blockchain technology. The decentralized application allows users to transfer assets anonymously using an immutable ledger on the POA ethereum blockchain. 
# 1.1 Target User
Target users will be movie and music enthusiasts with an active social network.  Third party applications can connect to and use the ledger by instantiating and writing to the smart contract.
# 1.2 Anticipated Remarkability
The decentralized nature of the application means that there is no single point of failure. Additionally, the immutable nature of blockchain means that the ledger can be authoritative for users, which can include third-party applications. The paradigm of transferable assets means that users will be incentivized to use the technology in order to have the ability to make digital swaps and will create buzz for future purchases on the network. Additionally, users will remain anonymous by using an ethereum address as an identity.
# 1.3 Comparable Technologies
Currently, competing technologies include other paid and free video content providers. However, no current application allows the exchange of digital assets across users.
# 1.4 Platform/technology
The Swap digital asset exchange system is built on smart contract technology using the Proof of Authority Ethereum network. Proof of Authority is new blockchain authentication algorithm which is much faster and cheaper to use than current Proof of Stake Algorithms. It uses firebase and MongoDB	 databases and Node Express server for the back end, and IOS Swift for the front end.
# 1.4 User Experience
After logging into a secure interface, the user can browse for new movies or play content which he or she currently owns. The user can also transfer content both temporarily or permanently to another users.
1.4.1 Detailed Steps for Use
1.	User logs in
2.	User browses to a movie to transfer
3.	User lends or transfers a movie to another user
